      "2. Prepare the soil: Tomatoes prefer loose, well-drained soil. Remove any weeds or grass from the area and loosen the soil with a garden fork or tiller. Add organic matter, such as compost or well-rotted manure, to improve the soil's fertility.\n",
      "\n",
      "3. Plant the seeds or seedlings: If you're starting from seeds, sow them indoors about 6-8 weeks before the last frost date in your area. Once the seedlings have grown a few sets of true leaves, transplant them into your garden. If you're using seedlings, dig a hole slightly larger than the root ball and gently place the seedling in the hole. Fill the hole with soil and water thoroughly.\n",
